Most of the front-end engineers will extend Airbnb‚Äôs eslint-config-airbnb rules of their ESLint configuration. It‚Äôs a nice choice at the beginning, but you may have some performance issue when your project grows up.

You can export `TIMING=1` and execute ESLint to get per-rule performance report.

As below image shows, the most of time spent on `import` related rules.

After we disabled the rules, the lint performance increased more than 3 times üéâ

Can we just disable the rule in the `.eslintrc`ü§î? No, you shouldn‚Äôt! Because the rule can make sure your code follows the standard or your team‚Äôs rules. Then, why I disable the rule in the IDE? Because most of the time spent on [static analytics](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import#static-analysis). Your code will not work at all if you import from the wrong path. That‚Äôs why I propose disable it in IDE. But please make sure you have CI run the lint otherwise your colleague will blame you üòÖ.

Below is a single file (~1k lines) lint performance comparison.

As you can see, this is 6 times faster than the original.

Let‚Äôs start setting up the IDE, you can choose ‚ÄúSublime Text &gt; Preferences &gt; Package Settings &gt; SublimeLinter &gt; Settings‚Äù

Then Sublime will open the new window with two split panels, the left one is default settings with comments and the right one is user settings.

Once you saved, Sublime will reload the settings. So you can test the performance difference right away. Below is the source of settings, you can just copy and paste it.
