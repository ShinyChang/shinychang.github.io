In the past 6 years, I’m a web engineer writing HTML/JS/CSS every day. Not only writing client side but also server side (PHP & Node.js). I’m familiar with jQuery, react.js, redux and webpack.

Writing an app is really hard for me to even if React-Native has been published for many years. I have no app any knowledge and cannot make beautiful UI on the App.

Until now, [flutter](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/12/flutter-10-googles-portable-ui-toolkit.html) 1.0 is published. flutter is an awesome framework for me. Which resolved my concern of how to create beautifully app simpler. I build my first app in my life which has the same behavior between iOS and Android in one day.

The transition animation is also smooth, I can’t believe I can finish it in one day. Kudo to flutter, which is easy to learn.

Not only app but flutter also planning to support Web ([hummingbird](https://medium.com/flutter-io/hummingbird-building-flutter-for-the-web-e687c2a023a8)). I can imagine it will change the web ecosystem in the future.

I am grateful that **honestbee** has organized a hackathon, which gives me the opportunity to realize this dream. [We are hiring for engineers](https://mit.jobs/jobs?utf8=✓&search=honestbee&c=), welcome to join the honestbee family.
